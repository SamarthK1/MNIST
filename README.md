# MNIST: Handwritten Digits Classification
---

The purpose of this repository is to simply familiarize myself with PyTorch and Tensorflow/Keras frameworks before I use them towards future projects. 
I used both frameworks to implement Multilayer Perceptron models on the MNIST dataset and was able to achieve high accuracies with both.

The following Notebooks are included:
* MNIST_PyTorch.ipynb
* MNIST_Keras.ipynb
